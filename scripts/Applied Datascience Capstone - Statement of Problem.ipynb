    "what is the relative cluster of neighbourhoods around Boroughs in Canada and what is the relative cluster of neighbourhoods around Boroughs in New York City. Is there any relationship or dissimilarity between cluster of enighbourhoods at Boroughs in Canada and New York City. These are the important questions we are going to be answering in our report.\n",

    "In addition, the both Dataset are structured in similar ways, that is in both Dataset, One Borough can have more than one Neighbourhood. We saw this in the maps that was displayed under both Dataset, there was a graphical representation that shows how much the Neighbourhoods were clustered around the Boroughs. A city with more clustered Neighbourhoods might be most suitable for a restaurant as situating a restaurant at the centra of a cluster makes it accessible to more Neighbourhoods. This is merely a statement that would be further explained in the coming week."
